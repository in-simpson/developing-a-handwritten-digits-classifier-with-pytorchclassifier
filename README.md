## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.x, Jupyter Notebook, PyTorch, and torchvision installed.

## Dataset

The MNIST database consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9).

## Model Architecture

The neural network includes:
- Input Layer: Flattened image (28x28)
- Hidden Layers: Fully connected layers with ReLU activation
- Output Layer: Fully connected layer with softmax activation

## Training and Evaluation

### Preprocessing

Images were converted to tensors, normalized, and flattened.

### Training

The model was trained using the Adam optimizer and Cross-Entropy Loss with a batch size of 64 for 10 epochs.

### Evaluation

The model's accuracy was evaluated on the test set, with hyperparameter tuning to achieve at least 90% accuracy.

## Results

The final model achieved an accuracy of **[your final accuracy]%** on the test set.

## Usage

Load the trained model and preprocess input images to make predictions on new data.
